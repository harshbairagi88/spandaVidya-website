## SpandaVidya AI

### Flagship Product: AI Cataract Detection & Analysis
Our flagship AI application allows users to capture and upload ocular images to obtain instantaneous, secure, and clinical-grade cataract assessment.

#### Workflow Pipeline
1. **Capture Eye Image**: Mobile-guided viewfinder interface aligns camera optics.
2. **Secure Upload**: End-to-end encrypted transfer via NestJS API.
3. **AI Analysis**: EfficientNet-B3 neural networks process anterior segment structures.
4. **Prediction**: Classification of cataract density stages with statistical certainty scoring.
5. **Clinical Report**: Immediate generation of structured PDF assessment documents.

#### Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Mobile Client**: React Native cross-platform application.
- **Backend API**: NestJS scalable node framework.
- **Machine Learning**: EfficientNet-B3 model classification hosted on HuggingFace.
- **Cloud Storage**: Highly secure, HIPAA-compliant AWS S3 storage buckets.
- **Computer Vision**: Ocular targeting, region-of-interest segmentation, and optical preprocessing.

---

## Future AI Products
- **Ayurvedic AI Consultation**: Conversational wellness consultation and Dosha guidance powered by Google Gemini.
- **AI Pulse Diagnostics**: Digital arterial wave Naadi diagnostics combining high-fidelity PPG signal analysis with classical Ayurvedic science.
- **Future AI Diagnostics**: Scalable API layer supporting external clinical models and integrations.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Landing Page**: A single-page layout featuring various sections such as Hero, Challenge, and Philosophy.
- **Scroll Animations**: Utilizes custom hooks (`useScrollReveal`, `useCountUp`) and GSAP for engaging scroll-based visibility and number counter animations.
- **Responsive Components**: Includes reusable UI components like Buttons, Cards, Navbar, and Footer.

## Architecture Overview

- **Overall pattern**: Component-based single-page application (SPA). The main view is assembled in `App.tsx` by importing modular sections and components.
- **Styling**: Global CSS injected via `theme.ts` alongside utility classes (likely Tailwind, inferred from `className` usage in files like `App.tsx`).
- **Logic**: Custom React hooks (`hooks.ts`) are used for scroll visibility tracking and animated counters.
- **Config**: Vite is configured to map `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `process.env.API_KEY` for client-side usage if needed.
